## Notes on first commit By Lin
* You may clone to your local repo and create your own branch when commit
* Forget about my data layer APIs for now, they just don't work. Let's write SQL directly.
* I created all view functions and associated HTML files for customer portal and seller portal. You may directly change the content of these files. Don't worry about the concurrency, we will merge later.
